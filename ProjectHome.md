[HIDE](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/hide/) (Health Information DE-identification) is a framework for de-identifying both structured and unstructured data. The main application of this software is to facilitate de-identification of medical data.

HIDE is a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) application using a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) document store.

See the [News](News.md), [Overview](Overview.md), [Installation](Installation.md), and [Using HIDE](http://mathcs.emory.edu/hide/doc/) pages for more information.

HIDE is currently under development by [James Gardner](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~jgardn3) under the direction of [Li Xiong](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lxiong) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu).
