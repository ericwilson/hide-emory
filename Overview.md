[HIDE](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/hide/) (Health Information DE-identification) is a framework for de-identifying unstructured data. The main application of this software is for de-identifying medical data for medical data publishing.

HIDE is a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) application using a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) document store. Here are the [installation instructions](Installation.md).

HIDE is currently under development by [James Gardner](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~jgardn3) under the direction of [Li Xiong](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lxiong/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu).
